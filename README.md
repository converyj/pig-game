# Pig Game 

This is a digital version of the popular game, Pig game. 

Uses simple JavaScript DOM Manipulation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/converyj/pig-game.git 
$ cd pig-game 
```
# How it works 
**Variation:** Played with two dice:

Each turn, a player rolls their dice until either a 1 is rolled or they decide to "hold" 
1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
